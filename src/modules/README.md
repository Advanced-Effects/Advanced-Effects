# src/modules

This folder contains the core application code. Core code is divided on modules. For example:
- `project_file`: code that states what the project file should have, and handles conversions. This includes objects, such as Rectangles, paths...
- `view_layers`: code that states how the canvas should be rendered. (tells the objects to draw themselves, adds selection, etc...)
